# Volleyball Topspin Serve Simulation (MATLAB) 🏐🌬️

This project simulates the trajectory of a volleyball topspin serve using MATLAB, with a focus on capturing realistic aerodynamic effects rather than idealized projectile motion. The model numerically solves the 2D equations of motion using `ode45`.

Key physics included are Reynolds-number-dependent aerodynamic drag and the Magnus force generated by ball spin. The Magnus coefficient is obtained from experimental data and curve-fit as a function of spin ratio, allowing the simulation to reproduce the sharp downward dip characteristic of topspin serves.

The code evaluates net clearance, determines the landing location, and classifies the serve as in or out using official court dimensions. This project demonstrates applied fluid mechanics, empirical modelling, and numerical simulation techniques suitable for sports and engineering applications.
